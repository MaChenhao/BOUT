When running elm-pb with default options, on hopper.nersc.gov, 
for 30 min debug job, by using the following commend 
>qsub bout_hopper_debug.pbs
the result for linear growth rate is shown in plots:
plot Elm_n15_pb_lineargrowthrate_diam_S8hyperRm4.ps and
Elm_n15_pb_lineargrowthrate_diam_S8hyperRm4.pdf.

For low resolution mesh nx=68, data/cbm18_dens8.grid_nx68ny64.nc, 
the growth rate is 0.275002 *Alfven time.

For high resolution mesh nx=516, data/cbm18_8_y064_x516_090309.nc
the growth rate is 0.186655 *Alfven time.

The diference is 47%.

The high resolution case should give growth-rate of 0.1867 in BOUT++
units, but this needs to be corrected to get the values which were
compared against ELITE. This is because the value of R/B used to get the
Alfven timescale is different between BOUT++ and ELITE: R/B = 1.804 for
BOUT++, and R/B=1.5 for ELITE. Growth-rates from BOUT++ therefore need
to be multiplied by 0.83 for comparison published in Plasma Physics 
and Controlled Fusion 53 (2011) 054005 by B D Dudson, X Q Xu, M V Umansky, 
H R Wilson and P B Snyder.
