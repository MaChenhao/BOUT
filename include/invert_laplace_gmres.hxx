/**************************************************************************
 * Class for non-linear Laplacian inversion
 *
 * Equation solved is: \nabla^2_\perp x + \nabla_perp c\cdot\nabla_\perp x + a x = b
 *
 * i.e. the same as invert_laplace.hxx
 * 
 * The difference is that here a and c can be 3D variables, not 2D
 * i.e. this solver does not need to make the Boussinesq approximation for
 * vorticity equation inversion.
 *
 * Optionally uses invert_laplace method as a preconditioner
 * 
 * Changelog: 
 *
 * 2010-05-04 Ben Dudson <bd512@york.ac.uk>
 *    * Initial version
