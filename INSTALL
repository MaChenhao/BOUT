------------
If you need pact on Mac:
Since I already built it (it requires byacc, which is a little of a
headache) I'll just send you the binaries I built. Unzip them into
/opt/hpc/pact.

Check out the code:
1) svn co svn+ssh://<username>@svn.nersc.gov/svn/bout/branches/bout++-petsc
2) cd bout++-petsc/BOUT++

Configure without petsc:
3) ./configure

Configure with petsc:
3a) ./configure --with-petsc --with-debug

Make:
4) make

Run an example:
5) cd examples/Advect1D
6) make
7) ./gas_compress

The bout++-petsc directory is updated to the latest revision. The
solution file will be u_petsc.sol (if configured with petsc) or
u_pvode.sol (if configured without petsc).

BOUT++ is written entirely in C++, and uses the PVODE and PACT libraries.
To compile you will need

1. A working copy of PACT, or at least the PDB part of the library
2. An MPI C++ compiler for compiling BOUT++
3. An MPI C compiler for PVODE. This is because PVODE will not compile
   using MPI C++ compilers.
4. GNU Make. Other version of make might work, but not tested


BUILDING AND INSTALLING BOUT++
==============================

To do a basic install, run the following

	./configure
	gmake

This will search for various things like MPI compilers and PACT libraries, 
complaining if it can't find something important. If this happens, you
can specify settings such as:

	./configure MPICC=mpicc  MPICXX=mpiCC  PACT=/usr/local/pact/

Alternately these can be set as environment variables

For other options to configure, run

	./configure --help

To compile the examples, run

	gmake examples

and to clean the distribution:

	gmake clean

USING BOUT++
============

To use BOUT++ you now have to set some environment variables

BOUT_TOP       Set to the root directory of BOUT++

for the IDL analysis you need to set:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH   should include the directory with pdb2idl.so
IDL_PATH          include BOUT_TOP / idllib /

Once these are defined, the examples directories can be moved anywhere and the Makefiles
 will still work. 

Simulation examples
-------------------

There are several example directories which contain simulations for testing the BOUT++ code


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

1. configure or make fails
   -----------------------

First check that what it's complaining about, and make sure you've set the MPI compilers and PACT
path correctly. Make sure you're using GNU Make.
If these are ok then as a last resort you can set the configuration manually:

In the BOUT++ root directory:

cp make.config.in   make.config

Now edit this file, setting the variables CFLAGS, CC (to the MPI C compiler), CXX (MPI C++ compiler),
RANLIB (usually just ranlib) and PACT (to path for PACT library). This is all the configure
script does. Now run make again. If this still fails then you're out of luck - contact one of
the BOUT++ maintainers or someone who knows Makefiles.
