TESTS FOR BOUT++
================

Advect1D           An advection in 1D of a 2D pulse

D3D_129131         Turbulence case from DIII-D tokamak

DriftInstability   Drift wave benchmark in a cylinder

InterchangeInstability 

OrszagTang         Orszag-Tang vortex problem in 2D ideal MHD

RayleighTaylor     Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a fluid

StaggerDrift       Same as DriftInstability, but can use staggered stencils

Uedge_benchmark    Axisymmetric tokamak benchmark against UEDGE

highbeta_elm       High-beta reduced MHD model for ELM simulations


Running the cases
=================

In most (some) cases, running the case consists of

$ ./runcase.sh
$ idl runidl.pro
